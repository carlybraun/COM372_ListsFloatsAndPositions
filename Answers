So I went through and did it last night on my own but forgot to record my observations

FLOATS
1. Aligned on the right
2. Aligned on the left
3. Div1 is aligned right and Div2 is aligned left
4. Div 1 is in the upper left corner, Div2 is in the lower right corner
5. I don't know...
6. They move with the size of the browser

8. "Good, good columns moving all over the place!"
9. Got them equally sized but they were not aligned all together
10. My columns are moving all over the place
11. Okay they are offically all over the place

LISTS
1. Like I said earlier, I went through and played last night. When I made the changes to the "list-style" property,
   the list bullets would either move in or out.
2. Then when I messed with the display property, the bullets disappeared and made the list into one line

POSITION
1. Box stayed on the border
2. Box moved in 100px
3. Box moved out 100px, you can't even see some of the box
4. Aligned on the left but room around the text, the padding
5. Moved in 200px
8. Whoa, the box went to the top left of the page
9. and now it's in the top right of the page
10. box moved in 100px worth from the right margin
12. now located on the bottom on the page, still 100px from the right margin
